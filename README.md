### Olympic Games Analysis
For the final project I plan to analyse multiple datasets on Olympic Games taken from Kaggle. I will combine the datasets by The Guardian, Petro, John Ostrowski, to make one large dataset that contains all the required information from the 1986-2008 games. I will also be analysing Olympics 2020-21 Tokyo Games using datasets by Petro and Berkey Alan on Kaggle. Then I will compare and contrast the historical games to the 2020-21 Tokyo Games. 

With this analysis I hope to answer the following research questions –

1)	Does the host country impact the medal tally?
2)	Is a country’s economic condition and population related to the medals they win in the Olympics 2020?
3)	Change in countries and events over time?
4)	Is there any gender discrimination in the Olympics?
5)	How do the physical attributes of an athlete impact his/her chances of winning a metal?
